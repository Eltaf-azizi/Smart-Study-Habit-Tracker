<h1 align="center">Smart Study Habit Tracker</h1>
  
Smart Study & Habit Tracker is a desktop application designed to help students improve their study consistency, build healthy habits, manage tasks, and track progress over time. The app focuses on clarity, motivation, and long-term growth rather than short-term pressure.

It is fully functional as a standalone desktop app and structured to be expanded into a high-level product in the future.

## Why This Project Exists

Many students struggle not because they lack ability, but because they lack visibility into how they use their time. Existing tools are either too simple to be useful or too complex to maintain consistently.

This project solves that by providing:

 - Clear study time tracking
 - Simple habit building
 - Task organization
 - Meaningful daily and weekly insight
 - Optional social motivation through leaderboards

All without invading privacy or overcomplicating the experience.
